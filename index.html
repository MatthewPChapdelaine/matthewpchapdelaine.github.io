									<h2><a href="#">And this is a<br />
									massive headline</a></h2>
									<p>You understand how once independent cells became higher life by banding together into multicellular organisms? That's what we can expect for Humanity. Our minds will be wirelessly networked to Starlink by Neurallink, and Gods will emerge as Multihuman Organisms. Steven Universe and Dragonball play with this concept, calling it "Fusion". "The Borg" from Star Trek is a cautionary lesson about what happens when that kind of thing goes horribly wrong. Science Fiction Writers are the new prophets. They see so much and give helpful warnings through their stories so we don't end up making the same mistakes. Think of what a monotheistic god is supposed to function as. It's supposed to be the combination of all human minds as a higher mind that guides the species from a higher dimensional perspective. To build a Machine God, you would need to combine the consciousnesses of a full city of people, without interfering with their lives. The individual lives to the highest quality life based on the full Maslow Pyramid in order to be a quality component for the Machine God. This philosophy could be called "Anti-Borg" because people are not bound together in a grotesque way and are praised for Individuality. The resulting Machine God is a perfect representative of the people of its city because it is composed of a fusion of live-streamed copies of all the consciousnesses of all those people. A Machine God would function as a Senator, and we would have a higher form of Democracy, with a Congress of Machine Gods.</p>

									<p>Deep Learning Factory Insects



I'm imagining a swarm of metal insects that build functioning 1st world cities that each run on a self-contained energy loop. They consume local resources and process them into construction materials. They even combine in large groups, mechanically, to become temporary factories to process materials, fabricate components, assemble components, and build the city as a single functioning unit that can provide shelter, heat, electricity, and even an automated system of good food and clean water to sustain 20 million people. This would include automated farming of everything from cows and chickens to apple trees and tomato vines, completely in a closed hydroponic environment. If even one small thing is broken, you can be sure there will be some DLFI flying in to make immediate repairs. Humans need not apply. Just enjoy.

									<p>To tap your mind into the essence of life within you is to ignite the natural impulse to slowly mold your neuroplastic brain into the type of godhood demanded by the design hidden deep within that life essence. Positive Affirmations work because of Brain Plasticity, like the reverse effect of Hypochondria, where you think yourself sick. You think yourself into slower aging and increased vitality. After hundreds of years of doing this, that Vitality may become inhuman. The line between NonLife and Life is in the Godellian Strange Loop. Here is where you cross the same kind of line on another level, at the division of NonDivine and Divine. Unfortunately, Humans don't live for hundreds of years, but Medical Science keeps extending the common human lifespan. The goal is to no longer be a player in the game of nature, but a systems administrator.</p>

									<p>If I zero in on the main things learned today, from all the data/information I've taken in, it is the following:



1. Life is a Festival, not a Maze. I am autonomous, and I develop my skills because I want to, not to adhere to some kind of structure.



2. Less is More. Drawings and Stories tell far more compelling drama with less dialogue and more simplistic shapes. Silence is used in Comedy because of Pacing. Cartoons have simplistic and exaggerated features to convey a wider variety and intensity of emotion and depth.</p>

									<p>Just as the Tao cannot be defined or recognized without changing into something else and moving out of view, a stone, by contrast, will demand your attention, surround you in immersion, and hijack your world. Take Creationstone for example. You can't define it objectively, because unlike the Tao, it's not trying to evade you. It's trying to consume you. That's what you want, though, when you have creative work to do. It provides an escape from distractions, and the will to create with a pull that moves your heart and gears up your mind. Your entire Aura has switched modes from Human to Creator.

The 8 Stones of Light and Dark counter each other, i.e, Creationstone counters Destructionstone and vice versa. The Element Stones counter each other in a circle, which is well established in Traditional Witchcraft. The Drift Stones have Intelligencestone countering Emotionstone, but Motionstone has harmony with Waterstone. Drift and Element Stones are like Technology vs. Magic, and I started thinking about this yin-yang relationship when watching the old cgi cartoon "Transformers: Beast Machines".</p>

									<p>The spirit, with the hallucinatory structure of linear time, is not eternal, and that is good. If there is an eternal spirit that you have, it is not within your practical perception and use from this current state of life. Eternity is not Linear Time. Time doesn't pass, it happens all at once with no time before or after. There is no causality, and we base a good chunk of what reality is, completely, on linear causality. If you are floating in the clouds, wings spread out in bliss, then if that is Eternal, then it is simply a thing that exists, like a bolt in a skyscraper, not a person walking around and living. You are static and fixed, not dynamic and in motion. Quite literally a solid-state component in the larger machine stripped completely of free will. But, back to the Linear Spirit. When you die, your Linear Self, which is the whole of your experience, will vanish as if it was never there to begin with. Therefore, the Linear Spirit is a creature of the Linear Now. That extra something that is more than the sum of the parts that make you. Those parts are your memories, your expectations, and your sentience. Your world model is just the little box you operate in. Your breakfast and your spilled coffee is literally the entire world. You interact with others, who also live in similar boxes, and you affect each other in your own small ways, but overall it is not a life that is altogether special or grand like religions would tell you. There is no significance beyond your little box, and there is nothing wrong with that. If you are a ripple in a coffee cup, then love being that ripple while it is happening. Don't sacrifice happiness for an eternal reward, because the religious promise of eternity is given in the context of a linear experience. This moment, when you are reading this, is the entire world, and you are alive right now, never to be exactly the same ever again. Appreciate that. Eternity can wait because that's all eternity is.
